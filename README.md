# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are examples of algorithms designed to **solve problems faster** with the help of a computer. There are several techniques that can be used each with different procedures for solving the same task. Some are better suited for use with a small database, while other for a larger database, and some are simpler than others. The fact is that they all illustrate basic rules for manipulating data structures.

In this repository, we will look at some sorting methods!!
